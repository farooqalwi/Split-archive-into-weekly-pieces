    " to conduct exams, either on-campus or online as long as the chosen mode provides a fair assessment of students' performance. Universities should take stock of their \"exam readiness\", i.e., technological readiness, managerial capacity, and the announced policy, and choose the best possible mode of assessment. \n\nOnline exams either can be used if the universities administer 'Open Book Exams' or establish an invigilation system in a supervised environment. In this mode, universities will also have to use Turnitin to check similarity index with Web and the answers of other students. Further, viva/oral exam may be integrated in the assessment where necessary.\n\nOn-campus exams can be used only under strict compliance with all Covid-19 health and safety protocols. Universities may also have to organize make-up classes for two weeks in case students consider the course coverage to be deficient. Assessment of all courses requiring psychomotor skills, such as medicine, engineering, subjects involving lab/studio work must be held on campus.\n\nAll students in a single course will be examined in the same mode i.e., either on-line or on-campus.\n\n",
